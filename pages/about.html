                    Hey there, my name is Jaipreet Singh and I’m a recent
                    engineering graduate looking to establish myself in the tech
                    industry as a software developer. I specialize in web
                    technologies and I'm passionate about creating memorable
                    visual experiences!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to software development when I took my
                    first introductory programming course in University where we
                    learned C++, and I instantly fell in love with the concept
                    of coding. Throughout the rest of my curriculum I’d take on
                    programming roles in group projects and seek out ways to
                    apply my programming skills at internships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my programming courses at school didn’t go beyond
                    elementary concepts, I would teach myself different
                    languages and more advanced concepts in my free time. I
                    eventually found myself getting into web development, and
                    given my extensive background in graphic design and rigorous
                    engineering curriculum, it felt like the perfect path to
                    pursue moving forward! Some of my development projects can
                    be seen below on my Github.

                    I’ve always been a creative person at my core. As a child I
                    would spend hours drawing in my sketchbooks, taking
                    inspiration from my favourite cartoons and anime. Around
                    2015, I became interested in content creation on YouTube and
                    joined a few friends to create videos and share them on our
                    channels which is when I picked up graphic design and video
                    editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started exploring various areas of design, learning
                    fundamental layout and typography concepts, colour theory,
                    etc. out of pure passion for the field. I shared my work on
                    social media and after building a following I began taking
                    commissions for my services. I was able to work with
                    established brands, build new brand identities, and
                    interface with clients. My graphic design work can be viewed
                    on my Behance profile.
