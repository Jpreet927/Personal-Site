                    Hey there, my name is Jaipreet Singh and Iâ€™m a final year
                    engineering student looking to establish myself in the tech
                    industry as a frontend developer. In my freetime I enjoy
                    graphic design, video editing, photography, and playing my
                    guitar (that I havenâ€™t touched in months ðŸ˜¬).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a senior in high school, I wasnâ€™t too sure what I wanted
                    to pursue moving into university, so I leaned towards my
                    strengths in math and physics and chose to pursue Electrical
                    Engineering. I wasnâ€™t very familiar with software
                    development until I took my first introductory programming
                    course where we learned C++. I instantly fell in love with
                    the concept of coding, and throughout the rest of my
                    curriculum Iâ€™d take on programming roles in group projects
                    and find ways to write automation scripts at internships to
                    streamline my tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my programming courses at school didnâ€™t go beyond
                    elementary concepts, I would teach myself different
                    languages and more advanced concepts in my free time. I
                    eventually found myself getting into frontend development,
                    and given my extensive background in graphic design and
                    rigorous engineering curriculum, it felt like the perfect
                    path to pursue moving forward! Some of my development
                    projects can be seen below on my Github.

                    Iâ€™ve always been a creative person at my core. As a child I
                    would spend hours drawing in my sketchbooks, taking
                    inspiration from my favourite cartoons and anime. Around
                    2015, I became interested in content creation on YouTube and
                    joined a few friends to create videos with each other and
                    share them on our channels. My group was just missing a
                    couple key roles - someone to edit our videos and someone to
                    create channel graphics, which is when I picked up graphic
                    design and video editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started exploring various areas of design, learning
                    fundamental layout and typography concepts, colour theory,
                    etc out of pure passion for the field. I shared my work on
                    social media and after building a following I began taking
                    commissions for my services, giving me experience with
                    working established brands, building new brand identities,
                    and interfacing with clients. My graphic design work can be
                    viewed on my Behance profile.
